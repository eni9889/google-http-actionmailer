# GoogleHttpActionmailer

An ActionMailer adapter to send email using Google's HTTPS Web API (instead of SMTP).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'google-http-actionmailer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install google-http-actionmailer

## Usage

Set up your `authorization` as described in the [Google API Client](https://github.com/google/google-api-ruby-client/#authorization) (the easiest method is to pass a valid access token), edit `config/application.rb` or `config/environments/$ENVIRONMENT.rb` and add/change the following to the ActionMailer configuration:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :google_http_actionmailer
config.action_mailer.google_http_actionmailer_settings = {
  authorization: ...,
  client_options: {
    application_name: ...,
    application_version: ...,
  },
  request_options: {
    retries: ...,
    header: ...,
  },
  message_options: {
    fields: ...,
    content_type: ...,
  }
}
```

For client and request options, you can look [here](https://github.com/google/google-api-ruby-client/blob/master/lib/google/apis/options.rb). And for message options, you can look at the `send_user_message` method [here](https://github.com/google/google-api-ruby-client/blob/master/generated/google/apis/gmail_v1/service.rb#L1150).

For dynamic setting of delivery method (this may be required given the access tokens usually expire):

```ruby
mail.delivery_method(
  GoogleHttpActionmailer::DeliveryMethod, {
  authorization: ...
})
```

Normal ActionMailer usage will now transparently be sent using Google's HTTPS API.
