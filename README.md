# GoogleHttpActionmailer

An ActionMailer adapter to send email using Google's HTTPS Web API (instead of SMTP).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'google-http-actionmailer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install google-http-actionmailer

## Usage

Set up your `authorization` as described in the [Google API Client](https://github.com/google/google-api-ruby-client/#authorization) (the easiest method is to pass a valid access token), edit `config/application.rb` or `config/environments/$ENVIRONMENT.rb` and add/change the following to the ActionMailer configuration:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :google_http_actionmailer

config.action_mailer.google_http_actionmailer_settings = {
  authorization: ...,
  client_options: {
    application_name: ...,
    application_version: ...,
  },
  request_options: {
    retries: ...,
    header: ...,
  },
  message_options: {
    fields: ...,
    content_type: ...,
  },
  delivery_options: {
    before_send: ...,
    after_send: ...,
  }
}
```

### Options

| option | details |
| ------ | ------- |
| authorization | This is the authorization, it could be a access token, etc as described in the [Google API Client](https://github.com/google/google-api-ruby-client/#authorization) |
| client_options | General client options as described in the [Google API Client options code](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-ruby-client/blob/0.26.0/lib/google/apis/options.rb#L38). |
| request_options | General request options as described in the [Google API Client options code](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-ruby-client/blob/0.26.0/lib/google/apis/options.rb#L62). |
| message_options | [Specific options](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-ruby-client/blob/0.26.0/generated/google/apis/gmail_v1/service.rb#L1075) for that message such as fields, content_type, upload_source and quota_user. |
| delivery_options | This currently contains hooks for before the message is sent and after the message is sent. |

For client and request options, you can look [here](https://github.com/google/google-api-ruby-client/blob/master/lib/google/apis/options.rb). And for message options, you can look at the `send_user_message` method [here](https://github.com/google/google-api-ruby-client/blob/master/generated/google/apis/gmail_v1/service.rb#L1150).

For dynamic setting of delivery method (this may be required given the access tokens usually expire):

```ruby
mail.delivery_method(
  GoogleHttpActionmailer::DeliveryMethod, {
  authorization: ...
})
```

Normal ActionMailer usage will now transparently be sent using Google's HTTPS API.

To use the delivery options pass a proc that takes two parameters mail (the object created by ActionMailer) and message (the object created by the Gmail API).

```ruby
GoogleHttpActionmailer::DeliveryMethod, {
  authorization: access_token,
  client_options: {
    application_name: ...,
    application_version: ...,
  },
  delivery_options: {
    after_send: ->(mail, message) {
      StorePostSendDetails.call(user: self, mail: mail, message: message)
    },
    before_send: ->(mail, message) {
      StorePreSendDetails.call(user: self, mail: mail, message: message)
    }
  }
}
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
